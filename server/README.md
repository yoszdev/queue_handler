## Scripts

### watch

This script enables TypeScript's watch mode, which continuously monitors the files in the project for changes and automatically recompiles them. It is useful during development as it saves time by avoiding manual triggering of compilation each time a change is made.
### start

This script starts the project by compiling the TypeScript code using tsc and then running the compiled JavaScript file src/index.js using nodemon.
